Lacking the patience to come up with a manual strategy and frustrated by one of the easier puzzles(!), I felt it would be much more satisfying to build a solver than just randomly flip pieces around for hours.
It turned out to be an excellent excuse to try out Cursor & AI-driven development in converting my original algo to JS and building out the UI.

Originally written as a C# console app, Cursor converted the algo to JS (correctly) but failed to bring across accurate piece definitions (weird). But it took only minor tweaking of those plus some colours to build a simple but easy-to-use UI, which I would have struggled with otherwise (not being a front end developer).

I was particularly pleased that it could be done as a single page project without any external resources as all the images are SVGs.
