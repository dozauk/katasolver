Lacking the patience to come up with a manual strategy and frustrated by one of the easier puzzles(!), I felt it would be much more satisfying to build a solver.
It turned out to be an excellent excuse to try out Cursor & AI-driven development in converting to JS and building the UI.

Originally written as a C# console app, Cursor converted the algo to JS (correctly) but failed to bring across accurate piece definitions (weird). But it took only minor tweaking of those plus some colours to build a simple but easy-to-use UI, which I would have struggled with otherwise (not being a front end developer).

I was particularly pleased that it could be done as a single page project without any external resources as all the images are SVGs.
